    description: `Prepare buns and toppings first and cook burger patties last. 
    Use refrigerated Ground Chuck Beef (80/20) – grind your own or buy it ground, but 20% fat is ideal. 
    Do not overwork your meat. 
    Shape the patties 1” wider than the bun since they shrink on the grill. 
    Make an indentation in the center to prevent it from plumping up in the center. 
    Season patties generously with salt and pepper just prior to cooking. Salt changes the structure of proteins and toughens burgers. Do not salt the ground beef before forming into patties. 
    Once on the grill, let patties brown and sear well (3-5 min) before flipping and do not press down on the burger.`,
